Web App which uses Ganache and Truffle suite along with a custom made Smart contract to reduce Gas fees and transaction times during NFT transactions.

Problem Statement: Essentially what happens is due to high OpenSea Volume , Gas Prices and transaction times in the blockchain reach sky high and hence lead to over-paid ETH transactions.

Solution: I have made a webapp which solves this problem , you essentially login through your wallet from our web app , use our custom Mainnet which we have enabled using our smart contract , which you can use during your NFT transactions which will tremendously reduce your Gas fees along with transaction times.
